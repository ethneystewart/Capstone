Capstone Project: Wave Energy Simulation

This was my final-year capstone project, completed in collaboration with three other students over an academic year. We aimed to design and simulate a wave energy harvesting system capable of converting ocean wave motion into electrical energy.

My primary contribution was leading the project's mathematical modelling and simulation aspect. I developed and implemented numerical simulations in Python to model the dynamic response of a buoy subjected to ocean wave forces. This involved:

Building simulations ranging from basic sinusoidal wave models to more complex representations using real-world data and the JONSWAP spectrum.

Integrating physical parameters such as buoyancy, damping, and wave excitation forces into differential equations that describe the system's motion.

Exploring different numerical integration methods, ultimately transitioning from Euler‚Äôs method to Runge-Kutta (RK45) for improved accuracy and stability.

Incorporating real wave data via the Open-Meteo Marine API to simulate realistic ocean conditions.

Collaborating closely with team members to interpret physical models, validate assumptions, and guide design decisions based on simulation results.

This project gave me hands-on experience translating physical systems into computational models, working with real environmental data, and applying advanced numerical techniques‚Äîall within a collaborative, multidisciplinary environment.

Simulation Files Overview
sim1.py
Basic simulation using constant and sinusoidal wave forces.

sim2.py
Builds on sim1.py. Varies parameters (e.g., buoy mass, damping) and runs the simulation for each combination to find the optimal setup.

sim3.py
First attempt at using real wave data to calculate force more accurately. Currently has issues with converging wave height.

sim4.py
Used for midterm presentation. Randomizes wave height and period using min/max values and adjusts them every 5 seconds to simulate real ocean variability.

sim5.py
Integrates wave height API data into the simulation.

sim6.py (no superposition)
Uses the JONSWAP spectrum to simulate ocean waves with a single peak frequency. Simple sinusoidal approximation.

sim6.py with superposition
More advanced wave modeling using the JONSWAP spectrum + superposition to simulate realistic multi-frequency ocean waves.

sim6-JONSWAP.py
Does not run properly, but contains well-commented JONSWAP equations for reference.

sim7.py
Switches from Euler‚Äôs method to Runge-Kutta (RK45) for more accurate integration using SciPy.

Wave3D.py
Same as sim7.py but includes a 3D plot of the wave model at the end.

API Integration
GET_DATA.py
Fetches wave height, period, and direction data from the Open-Meteo Marine API.
Stores data in an Excel file with the following sheets:

DEC1 ‚Äî Data from December 1st, 2024
